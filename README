================================================

Facebook App Boilerplate includes the following:

	: Gateway
	: Tab Page
	: Start Page

================================================

This is a boilerplate meant for developers looking to create a Facebook App with Flash.

The boilerplate includes a LIKE gateway, checking to see if users liked a page before revealing content. This is done both on the tab and the gateway. You can simply remove the like gateway if you wish to.

The gateway happens on index.php, which is what the page points to if you access the app directly, eg. http://apps.facebook.com/appname

Once the user is verified to have liked the page, the app prompts for a permission, which by default requests access to the user's e-mail address.

Once user allows it, the app goes to the start page which includes a 760px by 680px SWF file.
